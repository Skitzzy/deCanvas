# DeCanvas

DeCanvas is a decentralised pixel grid canvas, where anyone can change the colour of a pixel on chain. 


After 24 hours, the final collaborative artwork generated is turned into an NFT and auctioned off, with the proceeds going towards a charity chosen by an on chain vote of contributors


The NFT will contain the final image as well as a gif timelapse of how the canvas came to its final state. Each pixel stores a history of all contributing addresses and their colours.


We use Worldcoin verification of unique personhood to stop people spamming the canvas, and Lens Protocol to provide a user profile of people who have contributed to the final art piece.
